## About This Prototype

This repository contains a high-fidelity prototype that simulates the core user experience of "Heavenly Guide." This is not just a technical demo; it's a showcase of our product vision, demonstrating how we can turn complex astronomical data into a simple, emotional, and commercially viable product.

### Key Features Demonstrated:

*   **‚ú® Curated Experience Menu:** We've moved away from a complex map to an elegant, intuitive menu. This allows users to immediately choose a polished, story-driven experience.

*   **üìä Live Process Dashboard:** Upon selection, the user is presented with a dashboard where the "Process Log" animates in real-time. This "magic behind the curtain" builds anticipation and showcases the powerful engine at work.

*   **üó∫Ô∏è Real Google Maps API Integration:** The final dashboard includes an interactive Google Map, proving our ability to integrate with essential, industry-standard third-party services to provide real-world location context.

*   **üèÜ Gamification & Rewards:** Once the simulation is complete, the user is presented with a satisfying "Achievement Unlocked" award. This is a core part of our strategy to drive user engagement and retention.

*   **üîó Dynamic "Book Now" Link:** The "Book on Google Hotels" button isn't static. It dynamically generates a search link for the specific location, demonstrating a clear and direct path to monetization and partner integration.

## What's Next for Heavenly Guide
